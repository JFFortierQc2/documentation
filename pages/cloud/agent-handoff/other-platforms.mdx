# Agent Handoffs - Other Platforms

Agent handoffs refer to the transition of a conversation from an automated bot to a live agent. In essence, it is the process by which a chat initiated on a platform like Whatsapp is transferred and handled by a professional agent through a different platform, in this instance, Zendesk. 

You can also use this for automation processes that require human intervention. For example, if a user wants to cancel their subscription, you can use this to transfer the conversation to a live agent who can handle the cancellation conversation, then transfer the conversation back to the bot so that it may cancel the subscription.
