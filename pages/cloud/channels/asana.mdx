Asana Integration allows you to seamlessly connect your Botpress and Asana, a well-established project management platform. This integration equips your chatbot with the ability to manage projects and tasks right from its interface. 

To get started, you'll need to provide your Asana API token and workspace ID. After the setup, you can leverage the built-in functionalities to perform actions such as task creation, task updates, task comment addition, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Asana Integration, make sure you have the following:

- Access to an existing Asana workspace. 
- A valid API token generated from Asana (Personal Access Token). 

To obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT) from Asana, follow the instructions provided [here](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token).

You can obtain your workspace ID by visiting [this link](https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces) while logged in to your Asana account. The workspace ID corresponds to the `gid` parameter of the workspace you want to use.

## Enabling the Asana Integration

1. Go to the Botpress Hub and install the Asana Integration to your chatbot
2. Go to the Integrations tab for your bot and enable the Asana integration
3. For the API Token input, add the token taken from prerequisites
