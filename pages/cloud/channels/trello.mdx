This integration allows you to connect your Botpress chatbot with Trello, a leading project management platform. With this integration, you can easily manage your boards, lists and cards directly from your chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before leveraging this integration, ensure you have:

1. A [Trello account](https://trello.com/)
2. A board in Trello, with at least one list
3. The ID of the list where cards will be created. Refer to [this article](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello-questions/How-do-I-find-the-LIST-ID/qaq-p/2272862) to locate it.

## Enabling the Trello Integration

1. Navigate to the [Botpress Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) and locate Trello.
2. Access the Trello page and select the **Install** button. Here, designate the workspace and bot to install the integration in.
3. Either select "Go to bot" or return to the Integrations tab of your bot. Locate and click on Trello in the list.
4. Provide your Trello API key and your Trello API token to complete the Trello integration.
5. Visit the [Power-Ups Admin Page](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin) and click the **New** button to obtain the API key. Name the Power-Up as "Botpress Connector", fill in the email and author fields, then click **Create**.
6. Once the Power-Up is created, you will be redirected to API Key settings page, displayed below. Generate a new API key, then copy and paste this key into the **API Key** field in Botpress.
