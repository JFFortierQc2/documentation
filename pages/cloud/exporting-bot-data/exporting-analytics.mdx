## Exporting Bot Analytics

payload, (flow, node, card), user and conversation id

The Botpress Cloud dashboard provides you with an Analytics page with counters for the total number of users, new users, returning users, sessions and messages. It also shows a chart with the data and allows you to filter by date range.

While this interface is useful for understanding reach and engagement, it doesn't show information about the [conversations themselves](./exporting-conversations) and which path your users take when interacting with the bot. So in this tutorial we will show you how to export the analytics data from your chatbot to a third-party service.

## 1. Using the Botpress API

Make a request to `https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/admin/bots/<your-bot-id>/analytics` adding the following header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-personal-access-token>`.

<Callout type="note">
  You can find your personal access token in your [Botpress Dashboard](https://app.botpress.cloud/). Click your avatar
  and select "Personal Access Tokens". Generate a new one and copy it.
</Callout>

This is how the request would look like using Axios in a Javascript application:

```js
const requestConfig = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
  },
}

const getAnalytics = await axios.get(`https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/admin/${botId}/analytics`, requestConfig)

}
```
