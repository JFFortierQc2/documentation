![Extracting Bot data from Botpress](/docs/content/accessing-bot-data-outside-botpress.png)

Botpress Cloud allows you to create, manage, and deploy chatbots with little to no coding or infrastructure. In the natural course of maintaining a bot you may want to access its data outside of Botpress for various purposes, such as reporting, analysis, backup, or integration.

This documentation section covers some of the most important use cases for extracting bot data and accessing it outside of Botpress.
