On the Left Panel in your Botpress Studio, Click the Botpress icon and select **Chatbot Settings**.

## General Settings

### Chatbot Name

The **Chatbot Name** refers to the name of your chatbot that will be displayed as the identity or persona of the bot on various channels. It represents the character or entity that users interact with when communicating with the chatbot.

For example, if you have a chatbot designed to assist customers with travel bookings, you may choose an Avatar Name like **Travel Buddy**, **WanderlustBot**, or **TravelGuideX**. These names convey the bot's role and create an engaging and friendly persona for users to interact with.

On the other hand, if your chatbot is focused on providing technical support for software products, you might opt for a more professional-sounding Avatar Name like **TechAssist**, **SupportBot**, or **TechGenius**.

## Variables

### User Variables

[User Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#user-variables) are associated with individual users and are persistent. These variables can be set and accessed during the conversation with the chatbot. Examples of user variables may include user preferences or settings.

### Bot Variables

[Bot Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#bot-variables), on the other hand, are the same for all users of the bot and can be used to store information that is relevant to the chatbot's functionality or behavior.

### Configuration Variables

[Configuration Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#configuration-variables) are containers that store essential information such as API keys and database credentials, and allow chatbot developers to easily access and modify them as needed.
