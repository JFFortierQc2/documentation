## Workflow - Snap to Grid

The Snap to Grid feature in Botpress allows you to align nodes and connectors on the grid(flow-editor/canvas), making it easier to organize and visualize the flow of your chatbot.

To enable Snap to Grid, follow these steps:

1. Open the Botpress Studio and navigate to the Botpress Icon (top-left)
2. Go to **Preferences** -> Check the box -> **Workflow - Snap to Grid**.

Once Snap to Grid is enabled, the nodes and connectors will automatically align to the nearest grid lines when they are moved.

Note that the Snap to Grid feature is optional and can be disabled at any time by unchecking the **Snap to Grid** box in the settings menu.

### Freeform

When the **Snap to Grid** feature is turned off, the workflow editor allows for more free-form movement of nodes and connections. Nodes and connections can be dragged and placed anywhere on the canvas, without being automatically aligned to the grid. 

This can be useful for creating more complex and visually dynamic workflows that don't conform to a strict grid layout. 

However, it can also make it more difficult to align nodes and connections precisely, which may be necessary for ensuring the logical flow of the conversation.

## Benefits of using Snap to Grid

1. **Increased organization and clarity**: Snap to Grid helps to organize the flow of your chatbot by aligning nodes and connectors on a consistent grid.
2. **Time-saving**: Aligning nodes and connectors manually can be time-consuming. Snap to Grid makes this process faster and more efficient.
3. **Improved visual representation**: The visual representation of your chatbot becomes more clear and professional-looking with the use of Snap to Grid.
