# Introduction

Tables serve as a structured data storage mechanism that plays a crucial role in organizing information within your conversation flow.

# Cards

While you have the option to read and write to tables using code within Execute Code cards, which provides significant flexibility, there's a simpler method available: using Table cards. These cards are designed to streamline the creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of records from tables.

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that none of the cards below directly display the result. You'll always need to save the result in a
  variable first and then utilize it in the conversation.

## Get Record

This card is used to retrieve a specific record (row) from a table. It should be employed when you are certain
that the record exists and you possess its ID.

To use the card, begin by selecting the table from which you want to retrieve the record. Subsequently, choose the record ID you wish to retrieve. You can either select a default ID or toggle the input to allow for the use of variables.

Now, simply select the result variable that will store the record data. (You can create a new variable in the dropdown selection or employ an existing one, but remember that it needs to be of type Object since table records are objects.)

## Insert Record

This card is intended for inserting a new record (row) into a table. It should be used when you already possess the data to be saved and simply need to store it.

To utilize the card, initially select the table into which you want to insert the record. Once you do so, you will see a list of inputs representing all the columns in the table. For each column, you can define a default value or toggle the input to allow for the use of variables.

This card does not return any value, so there is no need to select a result variable.

## Update Record

This card is designed for updating an existing record (row) within a table. It is useful when you have both the record ID and the new data to be saved.

To utilize the card, first select the table in which you wish to update the record. Then, choose the record ID that requires updating. You can select a default ID or toggle the input to allow for the use of variables.

Click the "Add properties to update" button to select the columns you want to modify. For each column, you can define a default value or toggle the input to allow for the use of variables.

This card does not return any value, so there is no need to select a result variable.

## Delete Record

This card is for deleting an existing record (row) from a table. It should be employed when you already possess the record ID and wish to delete it.

To use this card, first select the table from which you want to delete the record. Then, choose the record ID you intend to delete. You can select a default ID or toggle the input to allow for the use of variables.

This card does not return any value, so there is no need to select a result variable.

<Callout type="error">
  Please exercise caution when using this card. Ensure that you are deleting the correct record (by identifying its ID
  in the Tables interface) and that you no longer require the record. Deleted records cannot be recovered!
</Callout>

## Find Records

This card is designed for locating records (rows) within a table. It is useful when you need to retrieve multiple
records based on specific criteria.

To employ this card, begin by selecting the table from which you want to retrieve records. Then, compose a filter expression in natural language to define the criteria for the records you wish to retrieve. You can also use variables in the Filter input to enable dynamic queries.

Now, simply select the result variable that will store the record data. (You can create a new variable in the dropdown selection or employ an existing one, but remember that it needs to be of type Array since table records are arrays.)
