# Utility Cards 

## Comment

The Comment card allows you to add a comment to the flow. It is useful to explain the flow to other people or to add notes to yourself.

Pick the Comment Card from the Utility Cards section in the Toolbox and drop it on the flow, or right-click the editor to see the Comment option. Click on the card to edit the content.

You can change the text size, color and style. You can add links, preformatted code and bullet point lists.  

## Image

The Image card allows you to add an image window to the flow. It prompts you to select a file from your local machine. The image can't be changed later.

## Video

The Video card allows you to add a video window to the flow. It accepts YouTube URLs and it's useful for adding relevant content that don't fit in notes or images. The video can't be changed later.
