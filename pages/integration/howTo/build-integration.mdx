# Building a Custom Integration

## Introduction

Are you keen to leverage the powerful capabilities of Botpress combined with your favorite applications? You're in the right place. This step-by-step guide will take you through the procedure of crafting a customized integration in Botpress. Integrations like these can supercharge your business operations, streamlining tasks, automating workflows, and enhancing productivity. For instance, you could:

- Integrate your customer relationship management system to effectively manage users and conversations via Botpress.
- Connect your e-commerce platform to optimize order tracking, customer communication, and invoice processing via your bots.
- Use analytics tools to track bot performance and user engagement in real-time.

This guide will primarily focus on integrating with ClickUp, a highly-respected project management tool. By creating this integration, you can automate task assignments, boost team collaboration, and streamline project management in your organization. If you're ready to unlock a whole new level of productivity, let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide and build your own integration, ensure you have the following:

- A Botpress account
- A ClickUp account
- A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text
- Node.js Package Manager (npm) installed. Please use Node version `18`. You can check your Node version by running `node --version` in your terminal.
- Ensure pnpm is installed and is on version 8. Check with `pnpm --version`. If not, install it following [these instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation).


### Setup

These steps should be done for every integration you create and are not specific to the ClickUp example.

1. `pnpm dlx @botpress/cli init`  - For Initialising the integrations template
2. select `integration` when prompted, and give it a name
3. `cd <integration-name>` - to go into the integration folder
4. `pnpm install @botpress/sdk @botpress/client zod axios` - sdk for botpress, client for clickup, zod for validation, axios for http requests
5. `pnpm install -D @botpress/cli typescript @types/node ts-node` - dev dependencies for botpress cli, typescript, node, ts-node
6. (recommended) initialize git and commit. This will help you track changes and revert if needed.
7. Add the following scripts to your package.json file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "version": "bp --version",
    "login": "bp login",
    "dev": "bp dev",
    "gen": "bp gen",
    "deploy": "bp deploy"
  },
```

### Setting up the integration files

Here we will be setting up the files that are required for the Clickup integration to work. You will be able to adapt these files based on the integration you are building.

There are two files you will work with.
- The main logic of your application lies in `index.ts`. This will be used to handle the creation of tasks, registration, and unregistration of the integration, webhook handling, and sending messages to ClickUp.
- The second important file is `integration.definition.ts`. This will be used to define the integration's name, version, configuration, events, actions, channels, messages, and user tags. This allows bot builders to have code completion within the Botpress Studio. 






#### Understanding Constant Declaration - src/const.ts

In the given code snippet, a constant is being exported which will be used throughout the integration. Naming conventions and the declaration of constants are important in maintaining the codebase and ensuring consistency across different parts of the application.

##### What this Line Does?
This line declares and exports a constant named `INTEGRATION_NAME`, and assigns it the string value `'clickupnew'`.

##### Code

```ts
// Declaring and exporting a constant named INTEGRATION_NAME with the value 'clickupnew'.
export const INTEGRATION_NAME = 'clickupnew'
```

<Callout type="info" >
  **Note** <br/>
  Make sure to set the value of INTEGRATION_NAME unique to your integration. This will be used to identify your integration in Botpress.
</Callout>


#### Understanding the Integration Logic - integration.definition.ts

This file, named **integration.definition.ts**, acts as a blueprint for our integration with Botpress. It meticulously outlines the structure and defines how our integration should behave, interact, and appear within the Botpress platform. Below is an in-depth description and comments in plain English for each part of this file to help understand its role and purpose in building this integration.

### What this file does?
It specifies the integration's name, version, configuration, events, actions, icon, channels, messages, and user tags. It acts as a contract between our service and Botpress, ensuring that the integration adheres to the expected structure and functionalities, allowing seamless interaction within the Botpress environment.

### The Role in Building Integration
This definition file is pivotal while building integration as it shapes the integration's behavior and interaction within Botpress. It ensures that all components of the integration are correctly configured and interact cohesively.

### Code

```ts
// Import necessary modules and definitions
import { IntegrationDefinition } from '@botpress/sdk'; // This imports the IntegrationDefinition class from Botpress SDK.
import z from 'zod'; // This imports zod, a library used for building schemas.
import {INTEGRATION_NAME} from './src/const'; // This imports the integration name from constants file located in src folder.

// This is where we define our integration using the IntegrationDefinition class.
export default new IntegrationDefinition({
    // The name and version of the integration are defined here.
    name: INTEGRATION_NAME, 
    version: '0.2.0',
    
    // This is where we define the configuration schema for our integration.
    configuration: {
        schema: z.object({
            apiKey: z.string(), // Defines that apiKey should be a string.
            teamId: z.string(), // Defines that teamId should be a string.
        })
    },
    
    // Events that our integration can handle are defined here.
    events: {
        taskCreated: {
            schema: z.object({id: z.string()}) // Defines the schema for taskCreated event.
        },
    },
    
    // Actions that our integration can perform are defined here.
    actions: {
        createTask: {
            input: {
                schema: z.object({
                  // Defines the input schema for creating a task.
                  listId: z.string(), 
                  name: z.string(), 
                  description: z.string().optional() // Description is optional.
                })
            },
            output: {
                schema: z.object({id: z.string()}) // Defines the output schema of creating a task.
            }
        }
    },
    
    // Specifies the icon of the integration.
    icon: 'icon.svg',
    
    // This is where we define channels and their messages, tags, etc.
    channels: {
        comment: {
            messages: {
                text: {
                    schema: z.object({text: z.string()}) // Defines the schema for text messages.
                }
            },
            message: {
                tags: {
                    id: {
                        title: "Message ID", // The title of the Message ID tag.
                        description: "Message ID from ClickUp", // Describes what the Message ID tag is.
                    }
                }
            },
            conversation: {
                tags: {
                    taskId: {
                        title: "Task ID", // The title of the Task ID tag.
                        description: "Task ID from ClickUp", // Describes what the Task ID tag is.
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    
    // Defines the user tags for our integration.
    user: {
        tags: {
            id: {
                title: "User ID", // The title of the User ID tag.
                description: "User ID from ClickUp", // Describes what the User ID tag is.
            }
        }
    }
});
```

#### Understanding the Integration Logic - src/index.ts

This file, **index.ts**, located in the **src** folder is pivotal and acts as the nerve center of our integration, handling various operations, interactions, and logic between Botpress and ClickUp. Below is a comprehensive commentary and explanation in plain English for each segment of this file, aiding in understanding its functions and roles in driving this integration.

##### What this file does?
This file handles the creation of tasks, registration, and unregistration of the integration, webhook handling, and sending messages to ClickUp. It encapsulates the logic needed for the integration to function cohesively and seamlessly within the Botpress environment.

##### The Role in Building Integration
This file is essential in building the integration as it contains the functions and logic that dictate how the integration will interact, behave, and perform its designated operations within Botpress and ClickUp.

##### Code

```ts
// Importing necessary modules, classes, and types.
import { Integration } from ".botpress";
import { ClickUpClient } from "./client";
import { comment } from ".botpress/implementation/channels";

// Declaring and exporting the Integration instance with defined actions, register methods, handlers, and channels.
export default new Integration({
    // Declaring actions that the integration can perform.
    actions: {
        createTask: async({ ctx, input }) => { 
            // Initializing ClickUpClient with necessary configurations.
            const clickup = new ClickUpClient(ctx.configuration.apiKey, ctx.configuration.teamId)
            // Creating a task and returning its ID.
            const task = await clickup.createTask(input)
            return { id: task.id }
        }
    },
    // Declaring the register method to enable and save the integration.
    register: async ({ctx, logger, webhookUrl}) => { 
        logger.forBot().info('ClickUp integration enabled')
        const clickup = new ClickUpClient(ctx.configuration.apiKey, ctx.configuration.teamId)
        
        // Fetching the user and registering the webhook.
        await clickup.getUser()
        await setWebhook(clickup, webhookUrl)
    },
    // Declaring the unregister method to delete the integration (not disable).
    unregister: async () => { },
    // Declaring the handler to manage incoming events from ClickUp.
    handler: async ({ctx, req, client, logger}) => { 
        if (!req.body) return;
        const body = JSON.parse(req.body)

        // Processing taskCommentPosted events.
        if (body.event === "taskCommentPosted") {
            const clickup = new ClickUpClient(ctx.configuration.apiKey, ctx.configuration.teamId)
            const botUser = await clickup.getUser()

            // Processing history items from ClickUp.
            for (const historyItem of body.history_items) {
                if(botUser.id === historyItem.user.id) continue;
                
                // Creating or fetching users, conversations, and messages from Botpress.
                const { user } = await client.getOrCreateUser({ tags: {"id": historyItem.user.id.toString()} })
                const { conversation } = await client.getOrCreateConversation({ channel: "comment", tags: {"taskId": body.task_id.toString()} })
                const { message } = await client.getOrCreateMessage({
                    conversationId: conversation.id,
                    userId: user.id,
                    type: "text",
                    payload: { text: historyItem.comment.text_content },
                    tags: {"id": historyItem.comment.id.toString()}
                })

                logger.forBot().debug(`Received comment from ClickUp: ${message.payload.text}`)
            }
        }
    },
    // Declaring channels and their message handling logic.
    channels: {
        comment: {
            messages: {
                text: async ({ctx, conversation, ack, payload, logger}) => { 
                    // Sending a text message to ClickUp from Botpress.
                    const clickup = new ClickUpClient(ctx.configuration.apiKey, ctx.configuration.teamId)
                    const comment = await clickup.createComment({ text: payload.text, taskId: conversation.tags["clickupnew:taskId"]! })
                    
                    logger.forBot().debug(`Comment Logs: ${comment}`)
                    logger.forBot().debug(`Logs:${payload.text}`)
                    await ack({tags: {"clickupnew:id": comment.id.toString()}})
                }
            }
        }
    }
})

// Function to set webhook for the ClickUp events.
async function setWebhook(clickup: ClickUpClient, webhookUrl: string) {
    const webhooks = await clickup.listWebhooks()
  
    for (const webhook of webhooks) {
        if (webhook.endpoint === webhookUrl) {
            await clickup.updateWebhook({
              endpoint: webhookUrl,
              status: 'active',
              webhookId: webhook.id,
              events: ['taskCommentPosted', 'taskCreated']
            })
            return
        }
    }
    await clickup.createWebhook({ endpoint: webhookUrl, events: ['taskCommentPosted', 'taskCreated'] })
}
```

#### Understanding the Client Logic - client.ts

The **client.ts** file is crucial in our integration, containing a set of predefined functions acting as the middleman between our Botpress integration and the ClickUp API. These functions are tailored to simplify and streamline the interaction process, making API calls more manageable and organized.

##### What this file does?
This file establishes a class, **ClickUpClient**, that encompasses methods to interact with various ClickUp API endpoints, thereby allowing the retrieval and manipulation of data such as user information, webhooks, comments, and tasks.

##### The Role in Building Integration
The predefined functions in this file facilitate interaction with the ClickUp API by handling requests and responses, making it an essential component in building and maintaining the robustness of the integration.

##### Code

```ts
// Importing necessary modules and defining the baseURL of the ClickUp API.
import axios, { AxiosInstance } from 'axios'
const baseURL = 'https://api.clickup.com/api/v2'

// Declaring the ClickUpClient class.
export class ClickUpClient {
  private axios: AxiosInstance  // Instance of Axios to make HTTP requests.

  // Constructor to initialize the ClickUpClient with token and teamId.
  constructor(private token: string, private teamId: string) {
    this.axios = axios.create({
      baseURL,  // Setting the base URL for the API.
      headers: { Authorization: this.token },  // Setting the Authorization header with the token.
    })
  }

  // Method to get user information.
  async getUser() {
    const { data } = await this.axios.get('/user')
    return data.user
  }

  // Method to list all the webhooks.
  async listWebhooks() {
    const { data } = await this.axios.get(`/team/${this.teamId}/webhook`)
    return data.webhooks
  }

  // Method to create a new webhook.
  async createWebhook(body: { endpoint: string, events: string[] }) {
    const { data } = await this.axios.post(`/team/${this.teamId}/webhook`, body)
    return data
  }

  // Method to update an existing webhook.
  async updateWebhook({ webhookId, ...body }: { webhookId: string, endpoint: string, events: string[]; status: 'active' }) {
    const { data } = await this.axios.put(`/webhook/${webhookId}`, body)
    return data
  }

  // Method to create a new comment on a task.
  async createComment({ taskId, text }: { taskId: string, text: string }) {
    const user = await this.getUser()
    const { data } = await this.axios.post(`/task/${taskId}/comment`, { comment_text: text, notify_all: false, assignee: user.id })
    return data
  }

  // Method to create a new task in a list.
  async createTask({ name, description, listId }: { listId: string; name: string, description?: string }) {
    const { data } = await this.axios.post(`/list/${listId}/task`, { name, description })
    return data
  }

  // Method to get information about a task.
  async getTask(taskId: string) {
    const { data } = await this.axios.get(`/task/${taskId}`)
    return data
  }
}
```


### Important CLI Commands

- `pnpm dlx @botpress/cli build` - Use this to build the integration
- `pnpm run deploy` - Use this to deploy the integration. 
- `pnpm run deploy -y` - Use this to deploy the integration without confirmation.
- `pnpm dlx @botpress/cli login`  - Use this to login to your botpress account. You will need to generate a personal access token from your botpress account. Go to Admin Dashboard → Profile → Personal Access Token. Generate a new one and paste it in the CLI.
