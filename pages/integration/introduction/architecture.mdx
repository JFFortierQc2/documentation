# Introduction:

Start with a brief overview of Botpress, what it is used for, and the importance of understanding its architecture.

## Key Concepts:

Outline and define the primary concepts users must understand when dealing with Botpress. This section could include an explanation of bots, modules, skills, actions, hooks, etc.

## Architecture Overview:

Present a high-level diagram of Botpress's architecture. Describe the core components and how they interact with each other.

###Conversation Communication Diagram
1.0 The external system (Slack, for example) receives a message from the user
1.1 The external system calls Botpress webhook and sends respective information to Botpress Handler
2.0 The integration handler defined in the integration code is called
3.0 After the handler code is executed, the transformed information is then sent to the platform API
4.0 Then to be directed to the respective bot to be processed.
5.0 After processing the message, the output is then sent back to the Platform API
6.0 Then it is transformed by the integration code to the way the external systems understands
7.0 The transformed message is then sent to the External System
7.1 The External System forwards the message to the user

###Conversation Communication Diagram
1.0 The external system (Slack, for example) matches an event/trigger conditions
1.1 The external system calls Botpress webhook and sends respective information to Botpress Handler
2.0 The respective integration event defined in the integration code is called
3.0 After the event code is executed, the transformed information is then sent to the platform API
4.0 The event is sent to the bot for processing
